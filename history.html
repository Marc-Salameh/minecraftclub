            Minecraft is a sandbox game developed by Mojang Studios. The
            game was created by Markus "Notch" Persson in the Java programming language. Following several early private
            testing versions, it was first made public in May 2009 before being fully released in November 2011, with
            Notch stepping down and Jens "Jeb" Bergensten taking over development. Minecraft is the best-selling video
            game in history, with over 238 million copies sold and nearly 140 million monthly active players as of 2021
            and has been ported to several platforms.

            In Minecraft, players explore a blocky, procedurally generated, three-dimensional world with virtually
            infinite terrain and may discover and extract raw materials, craft tools and items, and build structures,
            earthworks, and machines. Depending on their chosen game mode, players can fight hostile mobs, as well as
            cooperate with or compete against other players in the same world. Game modes include a survival mode (in
            which players must acquire resources to build in the world and maintain health) and a creative mode (in
            which players have unlimited resources and access to flight). There is also a wide variety of user-generated
            content, such as modifications, servers, skins, texture packs, and custom maps, which add new game mechanics
            and possibilities.

            Minecraft has received critical acclaim, winning several awards and later being cited as one of the greatest
            video games ever created. Social media, parodies, adaptations, merchandise, and the annual Minecon
            conventions played prominent roles in popularizing the game. The game has also been used in educational
            environments to teach chemistry, computer-aided design, and computer science. In 2014, Mojang and the
            Minecraft intellectual property were purchased by Microsoft for US$2.5 billion. Several spin-offs have also
            been made, including Minecraft: Story Mode, Minecraft Dungeons, Minecraft Earth, and the upcoming Minecraft
            Legends.

            Markus Alexej Persson; born 1 June 1979, also
            known as <b> Notch</b>, is a Swedish video game programmer and designer.
            He is best known for creating the sandbox video game Minecraft and for founding the video game company
            Mojang in 2009.
            <br />
            <br />
            Persson's principal venture for founding Mojang was Minecraft which gained popularity and support since its
            tech demo in 2009.Since then, he has gained significant notability within the video game industry,
            winning multiple awards and establishing relations with the industry's figureheads. He retained his
            position as the lead designer of Minecraft until the game's official launch in 2011, after which he
            transferred creative authority to Jens Bergensten. He had continued to work on Minecraft until he left
            Mojang in September 2014, after its acquisition by Microsoft for $2.5 billion. Microsoft eventually
            dissociated from Persson following controversial comments regarding topics such as race and gender on his
            Twitter account.
